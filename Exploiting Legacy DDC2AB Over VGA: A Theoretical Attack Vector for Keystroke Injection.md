## Abstract

This white paper presents a theoretical attack model in which a modified VGA cable leverages legacy DDC2AB (Display Data Channel/Access Bus) support on compatible graphics cards to inject unauthorized keystrokes into a host system. While modern systems primarily utilize DDC2B or DDC/CI for unidirectional monitor configuration, DDC2AB—now obsolete—offered bi-directional communication using an I²C-like protocol intended to unify display and input device control. This paper explores the feasibility, technical requirements, and security implications of resurrecting DDC2AB as a covert input vector in high-assurance or air-gapped environments.

## 1. Introduction

In the early 1990s, the VESA organization proposed DDC2AB as a means to consolidate peripheral communications via the VGA port. The protocol—an extension of the I²C-based ACCESS.bus—enabled two-way data exchange between a display and the host system, theoretically allowing monitors to relay input from keyboards and mice connected directly to them.

Although the standard was rapidly deprecated in favor of simpler and more reliable alternatives (e.g., DDC2B and USB), some early hardware maintained residual DDC2AB support. This raises a largely unexplored question in modern cybersecurity: _Could legacy support for DDC2AB be abused to inject keystrokes into a host system using a modified VGA cable?_

## 2. Background: The Forgotten DDC2AB

### 2.1 What is DDC2AB?

DDC2AB (Display Data Channel 2 Access Bus) was a superset of the ACCESS.bus protocol, combining VESA's display configuration protocols with bidirectional I²C communications. Intended to allow peripherals to communicate over the display connection, it theoretically supported:

- Monitor EDID data exchange
- Peripheral input (keyboard, mouse)
- Host-to-peripheral control commands

### 2.2 Why It Failed

- Fragility of shared communication lines
- Lack of support in operating systems and drivers
- Simpler alternatives like PS/2 and USB quickly dominated the market

Nonetheless, the protocol was implemented in a handful of graphics cards and monitors during the mid-1990s—especially in enterprise or embedded use cases.

## 3. The Attack Model

### 3.1 Assumptions

- The host system contains a graphics card with dormant or legacy-enabled DDC2AB support.
- The operating system or firmware does not explicitly disable ACCESS.bus device enumeration.
- A malicious actor gains physical access to the VGA cable.
- The attacker can replace or splice the VGA cable to inject fabricated I²C traffic.

### 3.2 Attack Components

- **Modified VGA Cable**: Intercepts and drives the SDA/SCL lines (pins 12 and 15 on VGA DE-15).
- **Microcontroller**: Emulates an ACCESS.bus-compatible keyboard (e.g., via Atmel or STM32).
- **Host Interface**: The graphics card must enumerate the injected peripheral and pass its input to the system.

### 3.3 Execution Path

1. **Cable Swap or Tamper**: Attacker replaces VGA cable with an augmented version containing a microcontroller.
2. **Peripheral Emulation**: The microcontroller simulates a keyboard via DDC2AB protocol.
3. **Keystroke Injection**: The device begins injecting preconfigured or remote-controlled keystrokes.
4. **Payload Execution**: Depending on timing and privileges, injected input could execute commands, elevate privileges, or establish persistence.

## 4. Proof-of-Concept Feasibility

### 4.1 Hardware Requirements

- VGA breakout or passthrough board
- I²C-capable microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi Pico, ATtiny)
- Host with DDC2AB-enabled firmware or BIOS fallback

### 4.2 Software Challenges

- DDC2AB enumeration protocols are undocumented or require reverse engineering
- Most modern OSs ignore legacy input buses like ACCESS.bus
- PCI option ROM or UEFI hooks may be necessary for low-level injection

## 5. Mitigation and Detection

### 5.1 Prevention

- **Disable legacy protocols** in BIOS/UEFI settings (if available)
- **Replace VGA** with digital interfaces (HDMI, DP) wherever possible
- **Seal physical connections** with tamper-evident hardware
- **Use cable authentication** technologies (e.g., USB-C smart cable controllers)

### 5.2 Detection

- Monitor for **unexpected I²C activity** on DDC lines (requires specialized hardware)
- Deploy **behavioral detection agents** for simulated human input at odd times or speeds
- Perform **physical inspections** of VGA and KVM switch cabling in high-security environments

## 6. Real-World Relevance

While theoretical, this attack model may be viable in legacy-rich sectors such as:

- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Government or military SCIFs using old hardware
- Secure enclaves relying on air-gapped VGA-only systems
- Environments where USB is blocked or closely monitored

Given the trend toward "retro" attacks that exploit overlooked hardware functionality, the resurrection of DDC2AB for keystroke injection is not outside the realm of plausibility—especially for advanced persistent threats (APTs) operating in highly targeted operations.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The DDC2AB protocol was designed to unify input and display interfaces through the VGA port—an idea ahead of its time, ultimately shelved in favor of more modular standards. However, its brief existence left behind an underexplored attack surface. If residual support exists in certain graphics adapters, a modified VGA cable could in theory be used to inject keystrokes by masquerading as a keyboard over DDC2AB.

In the age of firmware implants and hardware backdoors, even the long-dead ghosts of obsolete protocols deserve scrutiny.
